# Visual-Impairment-Aid-MuzzVIA-
A device which aims at providing aid to the visually impaired.



This project was  started with the aim of creating a DIY visual impairment aid that uses haptic and sound feedback. Basically it uses a distance sensor to measure how far objects are from it and then it beeps/vibrates accordingly (when far away it gives slow vibrations/long beep delay and close up it gives fast vibrations/quick beeps). Real quick we'll like to acknowledge that we are not the first to do something like this, but we we'll be adding a few features to it that would make it distinct from the designs you might have seen.


Being that this would most likely be our first device at Muzzware it won't be used for commercial purposes at the main time but just as a guide or moreover a prototype to make them for people who would actually benefit from having them!. The difference between this project and others for now would be that this project uses one distance sensor (as opposed to many) to make feedback more specific and simpler to interpret, use of both haptic and sound feedback, the mounting of the device under the arm and not attached to the hand (keeps it free to feel where you're going and use for daily tasks), and a few simple control buttons on the case (we'll also make efforts to put the word for each button in braille next to them).

 Improvements to the project would include:

 - Trying to mount the device on a different item such as the walking stick or a glove
 - Implementing the use of IR Sensors rather than ultrasonic sensors for a better widerange detection
 - Aim at making the design as compact and sturdy as possible
 - Battery time improvements

 A major aim of making this device would be for it to use a 'kit' of electronics that can be purchased at any electronics store worldwide. A basic knowledge of arduinos and very little programming skills like C would be needed to do make this device though, but we'll be including our code here for you to try it out! 

 Electronic parts to be used are as follows:
 - 1x Arduino Micro
 - 1x Buzzer speaker
 - 1x Slide switch (for on and off)
 - 2x Pushbuttons (I used large 12mm ones)
 - 2x Resistors (I used 2k Ohm ones)
 - 1x Quarter size proto board
 - 2x Vibrating motors (this isn't completely required if you have a buzzer, but is highly recommended)
 - 1x Distance sensor
 - 9V Battery
 - Wire

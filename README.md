# Visual-Impairment-Aid-MuzzVIA-
A device which aims at providing aid to the visually impaired.



This project was  started with the aim of creating a DIY visual impairment aid that uses haptic and sound feedback. Basically it uses a distance sensor to measure how far objects are from it and then it beeps/vibrates accordingly (when far away it gives slow vibrations/long beep delay and close up it gives fast vibrations/quick beeps). Real quick we'll like to acknowledge that we are not the first to do something like this, but we we'll be adding a few features to it that would make it distinct from the designs you might have seen.


 This won't be used for commercial purposes at the main time but just as a guide or moreover a prototype to make them for people who would actually benefit from having them. The difference between this project and others for now would be that this project uses one distance sensor (as opposed to many) to make feedback more specific and simpler to interpret, use of both haptic and sound feedback, the mounting of the device under the arm and not attached to the hand (keeps it free to feel where you're going and use for daily tasks), and a few simple control buttons on the case (we'll also make efforts to put the word for each button in braille next to them).

 Improvements to the project would be:

  What I really like about the design is how compact and sturdy it is. I wore it around for a few hours to get used to it and found it didn't hinder too many of my daily activities (I found it fit in sleeves too!).
